      <p>Butterflies are insects. There are almost 20,000 species of butterflies. The most common butterfly in the US is the Cabbage White. The Giant Swallowtail Butterfly is one of the largest butterflies with a wingspread between 4 to 7 inches. Butterflies have four wings that are actually transparent. The colors seen on butterfly wings are actually miniature scales that reflect light.
      <br>
      Butterflies, like other insects, have 6 legs. The first pair helps butterflies taste and smell, the second pair also have sensory receptors, and the third pair help them walk. The average lifetime of a butterfly is one month but can be shorter or longer depending on the species, size, climate and predation. </p>
