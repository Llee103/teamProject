      <p>Horses are mammals and there are over 600 breeds! Horses can have an average lifespan of 30 years and can run as fast as 45 mph. Horses are not native to North America. They were domesticated in Eurasia about 6000 years ago. There are no more ‘wild’ horses.
        <br>
      The most popular breed is the American Quarter Horse with more than 2.8 million horses in the world today. The Sorraia breed is the rarest horse breed with less than 200 left. Horses can move their eyes separately and can see 350 degrees around. </p>
