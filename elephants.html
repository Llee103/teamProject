      <p>Elephants are the world’s largest land animal averaging about 3m high and weighing up to 6 tons. There are 2 species of elephant: African and Asian. One major difference lies in their ears and trunks. African elephants have larger ears and have 2 ‘fingers’ at the tip of their trunks. Asian elephants have smaller ears and have 1 ‘finger’ at the tip of their trunks.
      <br>
      Elephant trunks can pick up things, smell, blow, suck up water, and breath. Elephant tusks are actually teeth  that help with feeding or defense. Their ivory tusks are valuable. Around 90% of African elephants have been wiped out in the past century because of the ivory trade. Asian elephants are also declining as well due to habitat changes.</p>
