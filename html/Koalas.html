        <h1 id="Animal 4"> Facts about Koalas: </h1>
        <p><ul>
            <li> Scientific name: Phascolarctos cinereus </li>
            <br>
            <li> Despite many misconceptions, koalas are marsupials and not bears!</li>
            <br>
            <li> They are quite picky eaters, eating less than 50 of over 700 eucalypt species. Even then, they’ll often choose leaves at the top of the tallest trees that contain more liquid and nutrients.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Since the leaves are so low in nutrients, koalas need more sleep than most animals which basically helps them conserve energy. About 18 hours! </li>
            <br>
            <li> Besides primates, koalas have fingerprints just like us! They also have unique patterns on their noses, which helps wildlife biologists to identify and track them. </li>           
            <br>
            <li> They have strong cartilage at the end of their curved spine, which allows them to live comfortably in their arboreal homes. This means that they have a thicker behind than most other animals. </li>
            <br>
