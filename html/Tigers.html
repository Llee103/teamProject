            <li>Tigers are known for being the silent hunter or aka "the silent killers" due to them having soft toe pads that help them walk silently through their  habitat</li>
            <li>. During the night they travel around 6-12 miles. When they travel to hunt food, their main prey is deer, and wild boar. For tigers, one out of ten hunts are successful.</li>
            <li> They would pull their meal into their covering spot, which consist of putting raking leaves, dirt, grass and rocks over their carcasses so that no one else would eat their meal</li> 
          <li> Tiger's growl is known as the "vocal repertoire of tigers".  They have different vocalization used to communicate different things. </li>
