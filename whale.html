    <p>Whales are some of the largest mammals on the planet! The blue whale is the largest animal ever and can grow up to 98ft long (29.9m). Newborn blue whales are about 23 feet (7m) long!
      <br>
    There are 41 species of whale. Some whales have teeth to eat large fish, squid and octopus. Other types of whales have baleen plates that sift food - plankton, krill, and small fish- into their mouths. Even though they have teeth, whales do no chew their food.
    <br>
    Whales are also known to have whale songs: a long, patterned sequence of sounds. Bowhead whales have over 184 distinct songs rivaling a few species of songbirds! Some humpback whale songs have been featured in album songs.
